        <h1 class="text-capitalize">things you thought will now be corrected</h1>
        <img src="ss.jpg">
        <p>Severus Snape is actually good and not bad, he actually killed Dumbeldore because Dumbledore asked Severus to.. You see he wanted the power of the Elder Wand to go to Severus so that Voldemort would not get it. And Severus had been told by Dumbledore to spy on the Dark Lord, and to do everything the Dark Lord says to do so that He Who Must Not Be Named does not doubt Severus.</p>
        <img id="dlvl" src="vldl.jpg">
        <p>Delphi was actually Voldemort's daughter and not really a Diggory. We come to know this by the end of Harry Potter And The Cursed Child.</p>

    <p>As many of you guys will think that Harry is a great Quidditch player and will go into quidditch later in his carrer but wrong, he did not take quidditch in his carrer his was only the Head of the Auror department but actually Ginny did. Yes as we all know know that she was also a great quidditch player and her fovaurite team was the Holyhead Harpies, so she played quidditch for The Holyhead Harpies all witch quidditch team as a chaser.</p>
